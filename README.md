Why? 

 The modern information landscape is a (see up) battlefield across thousands of documents, sources, and events. Reading and sorting everything is impossible. Conducting research with creative yet reliable methods is difficult.

Our approach?

Combining the qualitative with the quantitative. 

Design the question in natural language, the most profound programming language with the most flexible structure that is out there. This allows experts from many domains (journalists, researchers, NGOs, etc.) to work on the "lenses" that are used to extract the information from the content.

We apply these lenses methodically to our data stored in our [information spaces](https://docs.open-politics.org/information-spaces).

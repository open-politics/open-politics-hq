# Technical Summary of Changes for Enhanced Sharing & Portability

This document outlines the key technical modifications and additions made to enhance data sharing, export, and import capabilities within the application. The core strategy revolved around standardizing on a PackageBuilder and PackageImporter system for robust data transfer.

## I. Standardization on Package System (PackageBuilder/PackageImporter)

### PackageImporter Transaction Control
- Modified all `import_*_package` methods in PackageImporter (`backend/app/api/services/package_service.py`) to remove internal `self.session.commit()` calls
- They now rely on `self.session.flush()` for obtaining necessary IDs and defer transaction commits to the calling service
- This allows for more encompassing transaction management by the services orchestrating complex imports (e.g., Infospace import)

### ShareableService Refactoring
- **Dependencies**: ShareableService (`shareable_service.py`) constructor now correctly receives dependencies like `PackageService` (which handles `PackageBuilder` and `StorageProvider` interactions) and `InfospaceService`. The dependency injector in `deps.py` was updated accordingly.
- **Export Logic** (`_get_export_data_for_resource`, `export_resource`):
  - Refactored to use `PackageService.export_resource_package` (which internally uses `PackageBuilder.build_*_package()`) for `SOURCE`, `SCHEMA`, `RUN`, and `DATASET` resource types.
  - `export_resource` now intelligently creates either a `.zip` package (if the DataPackage contains files, e.g., for DataSources with original PDFs, or Datasets/Infospaces which are inherently ZIPs) or a `.json` file (for file-less packages like Schemas, or DataPackages without files)
  - Infospace export (`ResourceType.INFOSPACE`) was also updated to use this flow, now returning a DataPackage (ZIP) from `InfospaceService.export_infospace`
- **Batch Export Logic** (`export_resources_batch`):
  - Updated to correctly handle the DataPackage objects returned by the revised `_get_export_data_for_resource`
  - If a nested package has files (e.g., a DataSource), it's zipped individually and then added to the main batch ZIP
  - File-less packages are added as JSON
- **Import Logic** (`import_resource`):
  - Significantly refactored to handle both `.zip` packages and `.json` (file-less) package manifests
  - If a `.zip` is for an INFOSPACE, it's routed to `InfospaceService.import_infospace`
  - Other `.zip` packages (e.g., Dataset, DataSource with files) or `.json` manifests (e.g., Schema, Run) are processed using `PackageService.import_resource_package` (which uses `PackageImporter`)
  - Manages `session.commit()` or `session.rollback()` for imports handled by `PackageService`.

## II. Enhanced Dataset Functionality (for "Full Runs")

### `DatasetService.create_dataset_from_run`
- New method added to `dataset_service.py` to create a Dataset entity from a given `AnnotationRun` ID
- It populates the new Dataset with Asset IDs that have results for the run, and links the source `AnnotationRun` and `AnnotationSchema`(s)
- Schema IDs are gathered from `run.target_schemas`, then validated against the target infospace

### API Endpoint for Dataset from Run
- Added `POST /infospaces/{infospace_id}/annotation_runs/{run_id}/create_dataset` route (example path) to expose this service functionality

### `DatasetService.export_dataset_package` Refinements
- (This method is now part of `PackageBuilder.build_dataset_package` called by `PackageService`)
- Improved logic for including source files (`include_source_files=True` if applicable), especially for `BULK_PDF` DataSources, ensuring original filenames and correct storage paths are used
- Ensured proper serialization of nested `AnnotationSchema` and `AnnotationRun` objects within the dataset package manifest (using `.model_dump()`)
- Type hints and logging were improved

### API Endpoint for Dataset Export
- The `POST /shareables/export` (with `resource_type=DATASET`) route calls `ShareableService` which uses `PackageService` for the export.

### `DatasetService.get_dataset` Update
- The `infospace_id` parameter was made optional in some contexts to allow fetching a dataset by its owner user ID without strict infospace context, useful for share link scenarios (though direct service calls usually require `infospace_id` for validation).

## III. Comprehensive Infospace Export/Import

### InfospaceService Dependencies
- `InfospaceService.__init__` (`infospace_service.py`) now accepts `StorageProvider` and `ShareableService` (for token import) dependencies, and `source_instance_id`. `deps.py` updated.

### `InfospaceService.export_infospace` Overhaul
- Method is now async
- Returns a DataPackage
- Uses `PackageBuilder` to construct a comprehensive package:
  - Includes infospace details
  - Iterates through Sources, AnnotationSchemas, AnnotationRuns, and Datasets within the infospace
  - For each nested entity, calls the appropriate `builder.build_*_package()` method (e.g., `build_source_package`, `build_dataset_package`)
  - The content of these nested packages is stored in lists within the main infospace package's content (e.g., `sources_content`, `datasets_content`)
  - All files from nested packages are accumulated into the main PackageBuilder's files attribute, resulting in a single ZIP for the entire infospace

### `InfospaceService.import_infospace` Overhaul
- Method is now async and expects a filepath to an infospace ZIP package
- Loads the main DataPackage from the ZIP
- Creates a new Infospace for the importing user
- Uses `PackageImporter` to import nested entities:
  - Iterates through `sources_content`, `annotation_schemas_content`, etc., from the loaded package
  - For each nested entity's content, reconstructs a temporary DataPackage object (importantly, passing the files collection from the main infospace ZIP package to it)
  - Calls the relevant `importer.import_*_package()` method
- Manages the overall database transaction (commit/rollback)
- Cleans up the temporary ZIP file

### "Import Infospace from Token" Feature
- New method `InfospaceService.import_infospace_from_token` added
- Uses injected `ShareableService` to validate the share token and retrieve original infospace ID and owner ID
- Calls `self.export_infospace` to get the DataPackage of the source infospace
- Saves this package to a temporary ZIP
- Calls `self.import_infospace` to import from this temp ZIP into a new infospace for the current user
- Handles optional renaming of the newly imported infospace
- Cleans up the temp ZIP
- New API endpoint `POST /infospaces/import_from_token` (example path) in `infospaces.py` exposes this service method

## IV. "View Shared Dataset Package Summary" Feature

### New Pydantic Models (`schemas.py`)
- `DatasetPackageFileManifestItem`, `DatasetPackageEntitySummary`, `DatasetPackageSummary` created to structure the summary response

### `ShareableService.get_dataset_package_summary_from_token`
- New async method added to `shareable_service.py`
- Validates the dataset share token and retrieves original dataset ID and owner ID
- Calls `PackageService.export_resource_package` (which uses `PackageBuilder`) for the dataset.
- Parses the resulting DataPackage's metadata and content to populate and return a `DatasetPackageSummary`

### API Endpoint for Summary View
- New `GET /shareables/view_dataset_package_summary/{token}` route added in `shareables.py`

## V. General Improvements
- Improved logging with `exc_info=True` in several service error handlers
- Enhanced type hinting in various service methods
- Refinements in transaction management (commits deferred to higher-level service methods like `PackageService` or top-level import/export methods in `ShareableService` or `InfospaceService`)

This series of changes significantly enhances the application's capabilities for data exchange, backup, and collaborative workflows by providing structured, comprehensive, and consistent mechanisms for exporting and importing key entities and entire projects.

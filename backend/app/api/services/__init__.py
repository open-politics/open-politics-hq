"""
Services package.

This package contains the services that encapsulate the application's business logic.
Services abstract implementation details from the API layer and provide a clean interface
for performing business operations.

ðŸŽ¯ **Unified Content Discovery Architecture**
============================================

Core Services:
- ContentIngestionService: Unified content ingestion engine (Locator â†’ Discovery â†’ Retrieval â†’ Assets)
- SourceService: Source model management with unified discovery integration

The ContentIngestionService provides a single interface for all content patterns:
- Search queries â†’ scraped assets
- RSS feeds â†’ article assets  
- Direct file URLs â†’ document assets
- URL lists â†’ batch scraped assets
- Site discovery â†’ crawled assets

Legacy Support:
- All existing Source-based workflows are preserved
- SourceService bridges legacy and modern patterns
- Existing tasks and providers are fully reused

Note: DO NOT import service factories from this module to avoid circular dependencies.
Instead, import factories directly from app.api.deps.

# This file is intentionally minimal to avoid circular dependencies.
# All service factories should be imported from app.api.deps module.
